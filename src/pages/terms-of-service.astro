              <p>
                Clients must provide accurate, complete information about their
                operations, technical requirements, and PFAS transition
                challenges. Withholding material information may compromise
                advisory quality and outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clients are responsible for evaluating and implementing
                recommendations according to their own operational constraints,
                regulatory requirements, and business judgement. Independent
                verification of technical claims and vendor capabilities remains

              <p>
                Advisory services are billed according to engagement-specific
                terms agreed in writing prior to commencement. Unless otherwise
                specified, invoices are due within thirty (30) days of issue
                with payment accepted in USD, EUR, or GBP.
              </p>
              <p>
                Late payments accrue interest at 1.5% per month (or the maximum
                rate permitted by law, whichever is lower). We reserve the right
                to suspend services for accounts more than thirty (30) days past
                due until payment is received.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fees are generally non-refundable once work commences. If a
                client terminates an engagement before completion, fees for work
                performed to date remain due and payable. Expense
                reimbursements, if applicable, are specified in engagement
                agreements.

                We may modify these terms periodically to reflect service
                evolution, regulatory changes, or business requirements.
                Significant changes will be communicated to active clients with
                reasonable notice before taking effect.
